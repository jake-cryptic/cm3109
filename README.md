Please run using Python 3.10 or higher if possible, that is the version of python I used when developing this.

Example of running code:
```bash
python3 src/run.py
```

**Important**: Make sure to install numpy before running the application, as I use it to do matrix stuff

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR
pip install numpy==1.23.5
```

Should do the trick
